# Dominant Frequencies in 24 years of Phytoplankton Biomass
Identify the dominant frequencies in 24 years of phytoplankton biomass, using Fourier series and Dominant Frequencies State Analysis 

## Data collection
The dataset contains the concentration of chlorophyll (as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in 24 years from 1998 until 2021 at the sampling point near the Kimberley coastline, North- western Australia. The data records are collected and published in The Spatiotemporal Data & Time Series Toolkit by the COPEPOD project - a free and compiled resource for plankton and ecosystems data research.
